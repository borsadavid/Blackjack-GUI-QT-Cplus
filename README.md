# Blackjack-GUI-QT-Cplus
Blackjack GUI - QT C++ - Main branch with app.exe
                       - Master branch with Qt folder
I used Qt and C++ to create an interactive blackjack game. 
Mainly used OOP and Pointers.
Visual and audio effects implemented.
Player's progress is saved between playing sessions and highscore is determined by most currency ever owned.

The player can choose a bet and has the option to either draw another card or hold/stand to let the opponent draw it's cards.
Reaching 21 grants instant victory, going over 21 means instant loss, if neither go over 20, the winner is the one with higher points.
Rules: Cards from 2-9 value their number, cards from 10-Q value 10 points, and ace can be either 1 or 11 points depending on advantage.
